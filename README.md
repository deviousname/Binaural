# Binaural
Binaural Beats Chakra Meditation
This Python script generates a binaural beats playlist for meditation, focusing on the frequencies associated with the 7 chakras. The binaural beats are designed to have a difference equal to the Schumann resonance frequency.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
pydub library: Install using pip install pydub
Usage
Clone this repository or download the binaural_chakra_meditation.py script.
Run the script using python binaural_chakra_meditation.py.
The script will play a sequence of binaural beats, each corresponding to one of the 7 chakras, with a 10-minute duration and a 5-second transition between each beat. You can adjust the duration and transition time by modifying the play_time and transition_time parameters when creating the BinauralPlaylist object.

Customization
To customize the frequency pairs, modify the frequency_pairs list in the script. The frequencies should be in the form of (left_frequency, right_frequency).

You can also adjust the amplitude of the binaural beats by modifying the amplitude parameter when creating the BinauralPlaylist object. The amplitude should be a float between 0 and 1.

Disclaimer
Please make sure to use this script responsibly, keeping the frequencies within the safe range for human hearing (20 Hz - 20,000 Hz) and the amplitude at a comfortable level. The script includes safeguards to prevent the use of frequencies outside the safe range and amplitudes outside the valid range. However, it is the user's responsibility to ensure they are using the script safely and in accordance with their own preferences and health considerations.
